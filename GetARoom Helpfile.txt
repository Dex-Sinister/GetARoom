+getaroom                                                                   
                                                                              
  Using these commands, players can "get a room". This creates a temporary    
  room, linked to the room the player was in when they used the command. It   
  can only be done in or near the RP rooms or on the IC grid. If you          
  disconnect in a temporary room, you're automatically sent home. Once        
  everyone leaves a temporary room, it and its exits automatically delete     
  themselves.
  
  Looking at a temporary room's exit also shows the name of the room beyond.
  If you see a temporary room exit, please do look at it before you enter, to
  see whether the scene is open.
                                                                              
  SYNTAX: +getaroom <room>                                                    
  Creates a temporary room linked from your location. The exit alias is
  automatically built from the room name. Words that start with punctuation
  are skipped, so you can end a name with (open) or (closed) to mark your
  scene.
                                                                              
  SYNTAX: +getaroom <room>=<exit>                                             
  Creates a temporary room linked from your location, with a customised exit  
  alias.                                                                      

  The following commands can only be used inside a gotten room, and only if   
  you created it or otherwise control it.                                     
                                                                              
  SYNTAX: +getaroom/name <name>                                               
  Renames the gotten room.                                                    
                                                                              
  SYNTAX: +getaroom/desc <desc>                                               
  Changes the gotten room's description from its default.                     
  
  SYNTAX: +getaroom/load <desc name>                                          
  Loads a desc you've saved, replacing the gotten room's description.         
                                                                              
  You can 'save' descs by writing them into attributes that start with ROOM`. 
  For example, someone wants to save the desc of a seldom-RPed bathroom:      
                                                                              
  &ROOM`BATHROOM me=%r%tThe bathroom is built with a white-tiled floor and    
  pale blue walls. The sink and shower-cubicle crowd together - there isn't   
  even enough room for a proper bathtub.%t
